            rating="Hands down the BEST Cuban food I've ever had. And the service was exceptional. The owner clearly loves what he does. He gave me and my mom samples of his soup while he made our sandwiches. The soup was to die for-chunks of pork and slices of corn on the cob. It was incredibly flavorful. As good as it was, it couldn't compare to the yellow rice, black beans and sandwich. We ate until we nearly burst. I'd recommend this spot all day long. Go check it out. I promise you won't be disappointed!"
